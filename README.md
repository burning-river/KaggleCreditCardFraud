## About

Transaction fraud is a problem for all banks. In this project I am using the publicly available credit card transactions data set on Kaggle to build a model that predicts fraud transactions. The data set has 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for only 0.172% of all transactions. 

The final model correctly predicts 78% of the fraud transactions in the test set. Transaction amount is the 2nd most important feature of the model.
